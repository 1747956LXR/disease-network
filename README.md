# disease-network

### Abstract

This repository aims at:

- constructing a disease network which represents the relationship between different diseases
- constructing a temporal progression model of different diseases' progression over time for each individual patient
- disease prediction of a specific patient

via **Context-Sensitive Hawkes Process** or **cHawk**: multivariate Hawkes Process + every patient's context
